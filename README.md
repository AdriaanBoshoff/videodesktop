# VideoDesktop
A quick-n-dirty solution knocked up in Lazarus for playing a video as a wallpaper on the Windows platform. The program was inspired by [Wallpaper Engine](http://store.steampowered.com/app/431960/Wallpaper_Engine/).

The code is a little messy and I didn't really have the time to polish it up, but the barebones are there and the basic functionality is working as expected.

Here's a working website where binaries can be downloaded: [Official VideoDesktop website](http://videodesktop.net/).

### Third-party code and libraries
+ [libVLC](https://wiki.videolan.org/LibVLC/) and its [Pascal wrapper](http://prog.olsztyn.pl/paslibvlc/)
